<!--CSS can be added to HTML documents in 3 ways:
Inline - by using the style attribute inside HTML elements
Internal - by using a <style> element in the <head> section
External - by using a <link> element to link to an external CSS file-->

<body>
    <!--below is an example of inline CSS-->
    
    <h1 style="color:blue;">A Blue Heading</h1>
    <p style="color:red;">A red paragraph.</p>
    <P style="color: rgb(2, 89, 91);text-align: center;">When tags like "font", and color attributes were added to the HTML 3.2 specification, it started a nightmare for web developers.
        <br>Development of large websites, where fonts and color information were added to every single page, became a long and expensive process.
        <br>To solve this problem, the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) created CSS.
        <br>CSS removed the style formatting from the HTML page!
