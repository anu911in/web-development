   <h3>Some notes on italics and bold</h3>
         <p><em>Use "em" tag for italics as the "em" element represents stress emphasis of its contents</em></p>
         <p><i>"i" element represents text that is set off from the normal prose, such a foreign word, fictional character thoughts, 
          or when the text refers to the definition of a word instead of representing its semantic meaning.</i></p>
          <p><strong>Use "strong" for bold as element indicates that its contents have strong importance, seriousness, or urgency. 
          Browsers typically render the contents in bold type.</strong></p>
         <p><b>This "b" element helps in bold face. However, you should use the CSS "font-weight" property to create boldface text, 
          or the "strong" element to indicate that text is of special importance.</b></p>
